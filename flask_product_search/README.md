From Brian Hogan's book, Exercises for Programmers:

Create a program that takes a product name as input and retrieves the current price and quantity for that product. The product data is in a data file in the JSON format. Print out the product name, price, and quantity if the product is found. If no product matches the search, state that no product was found and start over.

This version of product search uses Flask.
