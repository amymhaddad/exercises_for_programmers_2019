From Brian Hogan's book, Exercises for Programmers:

Write a command- line todo list program that meets the following specifications:
* Prompt the user to enter a chore or task. Store the task in a permanent location so that the task persists when the program is restarted.
* Allow the user to enter as many tasks as desired but stop entering tasks by entering a blank task. Do not store the blank task.
* Display all the tasks.
* Allow the user to remove a task, to signify it’s been
completed.
