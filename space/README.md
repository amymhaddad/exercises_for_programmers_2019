From Brian Hogan's book, Exercises for Programmers:

Did you know you can find out exactly who’s in space right now? The Open Notify API provides that information. Visit http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json to see not only how many people are currently in space but also their names and which spacecraft they’re on. Create a program that pulls in this data and displays the information from this API in a tabular format.

Constraint: Read the data directly from the API and parse the results each time the program is run.
